I am Matt Bailey, a former corporate intelligence professional turned software engineer.

Having started coding daily since February 2024 (first in python, then in JS), I have in December 2024 completed a 3-month intensive full-stack SWE bootcamp at Brainstation in London. 

For my capstone project at Brainstation, I created a full-stack application for an annually hosted tennis tournament. This React/NodeJS application includes a dynamically populated draw, a live scoring page, and a head-to-head page showing historical results between any two of the tournament's past players (using MySQL tables).

I specialise in Javascript, CSS/SASS, React, and NodeJS.

    - 🎾 **Head-to-Head Page**  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showcasing historical results between any two players.  
    - 🏆 **Honours Board**

  - Check out the client repository [here](https://github.com/baileyma/matt-bailey-capstone) and the server repository [here](https://github.com/baileyma/matt-bailey-capstone-backend).

- **Investment Performance Tracker**: this app helps users quickly and clearly see the XIRR (non-finance speak: actual returns after accounting for deposits/withdrawals) on all their investment accounts.
  - 🌐 **Frontend**: Built with **React** with a component for each year for every account.  
  - ⚙️ **Backend**: Powered by **NodeJS** and **MySQL** to store all year-end balances and deposit/withdrawal transactions as well with back-end logic calculating the XIRR.  
  - 📊 **Features**:  
    - 📈 **Overview Page**  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing the actual returns of multiple investment accounts over many years.
