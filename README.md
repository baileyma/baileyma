I am Matt Bailey, a former corporate intelligence professional turned software engineer.

Having started coding daily since February 2024 (first in python, then in JS), I have in December 2024 completed a 3-month intensive full-stack SWE bootcamp at Brainstation in London. 

For my capstone project at Brainstation, I created a full-stack application for an annually hosted tennis tournament. This React/NodeJS application includes a dynamically populated draw, a live scoring page, and a head-to-head page showing historical results between any two of the tournament's past players (using MySQL tables).

I specialise in Javascript, CSS/SASS, React, and NodeJS.

### 🎾 Latest Project: **Investment Performance Tracker**

I am currently developing a **full-stack application** to help people track how well their savings/pension/investments are performing year-to-year.

It can be extremely complicated to work out exactly how well your investments/savings/pension pots have performed in a given year. This is because during any one year, you are likely to be making multiple deposits into (or withdrawals out of) your accounts. For example, when trying to assess how well your pension provider is doing for you, the your regular payments into the pension make it hard for you to see what percentage return your provider achieved for you in a certain year. 

To work out your actual returns each year (finance nerds would call it your 'Internal Rate of Return'), you need to have three things: your account balance on 1st January, your balance on 31st December, and all the deposits/withdrawals (both their values and the transaction date) that took place during the year. 

In this app, you can upload these three things for all the accounts you have (maybe you have an ISA and a pension pot). You can also add in accounts belonging to friends and family and see whose investments are doing best! More importantly, you can keep an eye on your pension provider and how well they are actually doing for you!
