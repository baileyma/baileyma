I am Matt Bailey, a former corporate intelligence professional turned software engineer.

Having started coding daily since February 2024 (first in python, then in JS), I have in December 2024 completed a 3-month intensive full-stack SWE bootcamp at Brainstation in London. 

For my capstone project at Brainstation, I created a full-stack application for an annually hosted tennis tournament. This React/NodeJS application includes a dynamically populated draw, a live scoring page, and a head-to-head page showing historical results between any two of the tournament's past players (using MySQL tables).

I specialise in Javascript, CSS/SASS, React, and NodeJS.
